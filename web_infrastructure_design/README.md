- *What is a server* : A server is a computer, a software program, or a virtual machine that provides services or resources to other computers or devices, known as clients. Servers are designed to respond to requests from clients, such as web browsers, and fulfill those requests by providing data or functionality
- *What is the role of the domain name* : A domain name is a human-readable address used to access resources on the internet. Its primary role is to map easily memorable domain names to IP addresses, making it simpler for users to navigate the web. It serves as a user-friendly identifier for websites and other services hosted on the internet
- *What type of DNS record www is in `www.foobar.com`* : The DNS record `www` in `www.foobar.com` is typically a **CNAME** (Canonical Name) record. It is used to map the subdomain `www` to the primary domain `foobar.com` indicating that the website is accessible via the `www` subdomain
- *What is the role of the web server* : The web server, in this context represented by Nginx, is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests from users' web browsers. It serves static content like HTML, CSS, and images directly to users and forwards dynamic requests to the application server. It acts as the entry point for user requests and plays a crucial role in processing and delivering web pages
- *What is the role of the application server* : The application server is responsible for hosting and executing the web application's codebase. It handles dynamic content generation, business logic, and database communication. When the web server forwards a request for dynamic content, the application server processes the request and generates the appropriate response to be sent back to the user
- *What is the role of the database* : The database, in this case, represented by MySQL, is responsible for storing, managing, and retrieving structured data. It stores information required by the web application, such as user accounts, product details, and more. The application server communicates with the database to retrieve and store data, ensuring data consistency and integrity
- *What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website* : The server uses the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to communicate with the user's computer when the user requests a website. HTTP is a protocol that defines the rules for requesting and transmitting web content. When a user's browser sends an HTTP request to the server, the server processes the request and returns an HTTP response, which includes the requested web content (HTML, images, etc.)
  - **Potential issues**
    - **SPOF** : The term "Single Point of Failure" (SPOF) refers to a critical component or system within the infrastructure that, if it fails, can result in the entire service becoming unavailable. In this one-server infrastructure, the server itself represents a SPOF. If the server experiences a hardware failure, software crash, or any other issue, the entire website becomes inaccessible. To address this, redundancy measures should be implemented, such as load balancing or failover systems
    - **Downtime when maintenance needed** : When maintenance or updates are necessary, such as deploying new code or installing security patches, it often requires taking the web server offline temporarily. During this downtime, the website becomes inaccessible to users. This can lead to a poor user experience and potential loss of revenue for the business. To minimize downtime, strategies like rolling updates, blue-green deployments, and hot-swapping servers can be implemented
    - **Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic** : In this infrastructure with a single server, there are limitations to handling a sudden increase in incoming traffic. If the website experiences a surge in users, the server may become overwhelmed, resulting in slower response times or even downtime. To address scalability issues, it's necessary to implement horizontal scaling, which involves adding more servers and distributing traffic among them using load balancing. This way, the infrastructure can handle increased traffic effectively
